# Reading Lots of data over Bluetooth LE

Not a good idea to stream data via BLE. That said, take a look here, for the older way of doing it:

https://github.com/don/rfduino-logreader

And, more recently:

* https://interrupt.memfault.com/blog/ble-throughput-primer
* https://punchthrough.com/blog/posts/maximizing-ble-throughput-on-ios-and-android
* https://punchthrough.com/maximizing-ble-throughput-part-2-use-larger-att-mtu-2/
* https://punchthrough.com/pt-blog-post/maximizing-ble-throughput-part-3-data-length-extension-dle/


The primer suggests we can get a throughput of about 12KB per second on iPhone iOS > 10, using an 185 byte MTU  (max transmisstion unit)

That means 341 secs  (nearly 6 minutes) for a 4MB file, and we have to be very careful, because the software stack may drop data silently.

It gets worse. iOS is only one side of the link. The other is the RPi.

Early tests show that RPi 3 B supports Bluetooth BLE 4.1, which does not support DLE (data length expansion) this means the MTU is kept at 20 bytes, which is around 1KB per second - truly awful.

Useful info and RPis and chipsets: https://www.argenox.com/library/bluetooth-low-energy/using-raspberry-pi-ble/
   * RPi 3 B  : Bluetooth 4.1
   * RPi 3 B+ : Bluetooth 4.2
   * RPi 4 B  : Bluetooth 5.0

**Mitigation: Keep file size to a minimum. One file**

1. Measure for a maximum period of 1 day:

Measuring at one measurement per second gives us 60 * 60 * 24 = 86400 measurements in a 24 hour period.

2. Change the file format:
   1. Provide a header, describing the data. E.g. 200 bytes
   2. Provide a title per channel. 20 bytes
   3. Provide a channel type byte (float, int) per channel (1 byte)
   4. Encode each channel as 64 bits (8 bytes)
   5. Group all measurements in rows. Each row has a with a time stamp of 64 bits (8 bytes)

Data size (bytes):

C = number of channels

R = data rate (samples per second)

P = period of measurement (seconds)

200 + C(20 + 1) + PR(8C + 8) 

for a 24 hour period, measuring heart rate, skin galvo and PRV as floating-point at the rate of 1 sample per second:

200 + 3(20 +1) + 86400* 1(8*3 + 8) = 200 + 63 + (86400 * 32) = 2765063 bytes = 2700Kb = 2.6Mb

Give a potential data rate of 12 Kb/s, this gives a file upload time of 225s = 3.75 minutes...

**Mitigation: any software or hardware changes?**

1. BLE UART (Note: Very Low Data Rate): 
   https://github.com/don/cordova-plugin-ble-central/tree/master/examples/redbearlab
   https://github.com/xykox/nrfUART-echo
2. Bluetooth Classic: Still supported by RPi
Bluetooth 'classic' is still in the bluetooth spec. Some manufacturers support it, some don't. RPi *does* support it. 
https://learn.adafruit.com/install-bluez-on-the-raspberry-pi/overview
3. If we want to support both Android *and* iOS (we do), we need to rely on BLE first: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38460162/how-to-use-bluetooth-on-iphone-in-cordova-application
   * https://github.com/don/cordova-plugin-ble-central - BLE on iOS and android
   * https://github.com/don/BluetoothSerial - will use BLE on iOs and BT Classic on Android
4. Bluetooth 5.0 Dongles will help with data transfer rate:

   * https://uk.farnell.com/nordic-semiconductor/nrf52840-dongle/bluetooth-module-v5-2mbps/dp/2902521
   * https://www.digikey.co.uk/product-detail/en/laird-wireless-thermal-systems/BT851/BT851-ND/8251358
5. But this isn't  a panacea:
   * https://devzone.nordicsemi.com/f/nordic-q-a/47503/bluetooth-5-0-file-transfer

The Laird BT dongle above is the most convenient, but the manufacturer lead time is 12 weeks. Too late for us!
The Nordic BT dongle will need some [additional set-up](https://www.nordicsemi.com/Software-and-tools/Software/S140), but it is an amazing bit of kit, and available in a couple of days and there are [many others](https://devzone.nordicsemi.com/f/nordic-q-a/28640/maximum-att-mtu-for-ble-nus) doing the same thing.

## Conclusion

Change file format, to minimise file size, and include annotations in same file.

Enable BT classic and BT LE on RPi.

On mobile, use cordova plugin for BLE for discovery, start-stop of processes such as logging.

On mobile, use cordova plugin for BT Serial for data transfer. It should be fast over Android, slow over iOS.

Increase MTU on RPi, using BT5.0, or we will wait for ever. Example [here](https://www.tonymacx86.com/threads/how-to-bluetooth-5-0-usb-dongle-guide.287115/), [here](https://github.com/don/BluetoothSerial)

Currently, our source code examples support BLE only. We'll be looking at BT serial in the coming days.
