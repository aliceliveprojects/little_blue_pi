# Bluetooth LE

Using the following resources:

https://www.hackster.io/inmyorbit/build-a-mobile-app-that-connects-to-your-rpi-3-using-ble-7a7c2c

I'm running RPi remote, via VSCode, running unmodified, updated, Raspbian installation.

1. On the RPi (In VSCode's Terminal) run:

   1. `hcitool | grep ver` for me, this returns `hcitool - HCI Tool ver 5.50`

2. Look at the bluetooth current status:

3. ```bash
   pi@raspberrypi:~/Documents/github/little_blue_pi/little_blue_pi $ sudo systemctl status bluetooth
   ● bluetooth.service - Bluetooth service
      Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/bluetooth.service; enabled; vendor preset: enabled

        Docs: man:bluetoothd(8)
    Main PID: 536 (bluetoothd)
      Status: "Running"

   ```

4. No idea what that is, but I know I have a Bluetooth daemon, at least.

5. In order for the *Bleno* library to work you need to stop the bluetooth daemon. The following command will stop the daemon and print the status of the daemon to verify that it has been stopped. 

6. ```bash
   sudo systemctl stop bluetooth
   sudo systemctl status bluetooth
   ```

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl status bluetooth
   ● bluetooth.service - Bluetooth service
      Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/bluetooth.service; enabled; vendor preset: enabled

   ```

6. From the above resource:

   "Note that this is temporary, if you reboot your Raspberry Pi 3, the daemon will start again. You can disable the daemon permanently by running the following command:

   ```
   sudo systemctl disable bluetooth
   ```

   This might cause you issues later on if you are trying to use the Bluetooth connection in another way. You also need to power up the Bluetooth adapter after stopping the bluetooth daemon. 

   ```
   sudo hciconfig hci0 up
   ```

7. Based on the above resource: 

8. Make sure OS is updated:

   ```bash
   sudo apt-get update 
   ```

   

   The next step is to install the latest LTS version of *Node.js*.

9. Find out the lastest LST version [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) right now, it's `12.14.1`

   ```bash
   # Making sure we get past the pesky lock file
   sudo su
   
   # Now we are SUPER
   
   # Adding the NodeSource APT repository for Debian-based distributions repository AND the PGP key for verifying packages 
   # Note my use of the correct version
   curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_12.14.1 | bash -
   
   # Install Node.js from the Debian-based distributions repository
   apt-get install -y nodejs
   ```

   

10. Verify that you succeeded to install node by trying the following commands:

    1. for node: `node -v` I get: `v12.14.1`
    2. for npm: `npm -v` I get `6.13.4`

11. Now install debug libs: (note we are still under `sudo su`)

    1. ```bash
       apt-get install bluetooth bluez libbluetooth-dev libudev-dev
       ```

12. Now ensure that your working directory is in the root of this project

13. There's a problem with the building of the `node-bluetooth-hci-socket` component on anything above node 8. See [here](https://github.com/noble/node-bluetooth-hci-socket/issues/84)

14. A very kind individual has forked and repaired. See [here](https://github.com/noble/bleno/pull/423). We need to install components which have been forked from the original. There seems to be an issue with getting the corrected functionality into the original project repos, and so the community uses the @abandonware moniker to underline this fact.

15. The corrections are available at:

    1. https://github.com/abandonware/bleno

16. Installation according to: https://www.npmjs.com/package/@abandonware/bleno/v/0.5.1-0

    1.  you can alias packages, so that you have to edit any 'requires' to patch the correct code. See the end of this issue: https://github.com/noble/node-bluetooth-hci-socket/issues/107
    2. Our code references 'bleno', and that should  actually be abandonware bleno, so:
    3. npm install bleno@npm:@abandonware/bleno@0.5.1-0 --unsafe-perm`

13. Then run the application (note, we are still under `sudo su`)

    1. `node index.js`

    2. ```bash
       ...
       lots of other stuff here, followed by...
       ...
       
       
       + @abandonware/bleno@0.5.1-0 (as bleno)

14. The application uses a UUID to advertise itsself: `ff51b30e-d7e2-4d93-8842-a7c4a57dfb08`. You can generate your own, here: 'https://www.uuidgenerator.net/'.

15. Testing. 

    1. I have an iPhone, and have downloaded and installed [nRF Connect](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/nrf-connect/id1054362403) from the App Store
    2. I start the App, and scan. I can see the entry for: `ff51b30e-d7e2-4d93-8842-a7c4a57dfb08`

16. Yay!
