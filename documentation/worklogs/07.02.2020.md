# Reading Lots of data over Bluetooth LE

Not a good idea to stream data via BLE. That said, take a look here, for the older way of doing it:

https://github.com/don/rfduino-logreader

And, more recently:

https://interrupt.memfault.com/blog/ble-throughput-primer
https://punchthrough.com/blog/posts/maximizing-ble-throughput-on-ios-and-android

The primer suggests we can get a throughput of about 12KB per second.

That means 341 secs  (nearly 6 minutes) for a 4MB file, and we have to be very careful, because the software stack may drop data silently.

Early tests show that RPi 3 B supports BLE 4.1, which does not support DLE (data length expansion) this means the MTU (max transmisstion unit) is kept at 20 bytes, which is poor.

Note: The Data field is dependent on the Bluetooth specification. In Bluetooth v4.0 and 4.1, the maximum size of the Data field is 27 bytes. Bluetooth v4.2, a new feature was added to exchange the Data field length.

**Mitigation: Keep file size to a minimum:**

1. Measure for a maximum period of 1 day:

Measuring at one measurement per second gives us 60 * 60 * 24 = 86400 measurements in a 24 hour period.

2. Change the file format:
   1. Provide a header, describing the data. E.g. 200 bytes
   2. Provide a title per channel. 20 bytes
   3. Provide a channel type byte (float, int) per channel (1 byte)
   4. Encode each channel as 64 bits (8 bytes)
   5. Group all measurements in rows. Each row has a with a time stamp of 64 bits (8 bytes)

Data size (bytes):

C = number of channels

R = data rate (samples per second)

P = period of measurement (seconds)

200 + C(20 + 1) + PR(8C + 8) 

for a 24 hour period, measuring heart rate, skin galvo and PRV as floating-point at the rate of 1 sample per second:

200 + 3(20 +1) + 86400* 1(8*3 + 8) = 200 + 63 + (86400 * 32) = 2765063 bytes = 2700Kb = 2.6Mb

Give a potential data rate of 12 Kb/s, this gives a file upload time of 225s = 3.75 minutes...

**Mitigation: Change streaming technology** Bluetooth Classic?


1. BLE UART (Note: Very Low Data Rate):

   https://github.com/xykox/nrfUART-echo
   
2. Bluetooth Classic:

3. If we want to support both Android and iOS, we need to rely on BLE: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38460162/how-to-use-bluetooth-on-iphone-in-cordova-application

4. Note: Bluetooth 'classic' is still in the bluetooth spec. Some manufacturers support it, some don't. RPi *does* support it. However it is more complicated to set-up, and we don't have time to go into it.

5. Useful info and RPis and chipsets: https://www.argenox.com/library/bluetooth-low-energy/using-raspberry-pi-ble/
   * RPi 3 B  : Bluetooth 4.1
   * RPi 3 B+ : Bluetooth 4.2
   * RPi 4 B  : Bluetooth 5.0


## Conclusion

Change file format, to minimise file size, and include annotations in same file
Protocol required to read and write to UART.
