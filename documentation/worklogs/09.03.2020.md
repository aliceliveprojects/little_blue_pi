BLE working; now, is BT Classic / RFCOMM possible, at the same time?

Currently, we are running the BlueZ stack. The following protocols are supported:

http://www.bluez.org/profiles/

Supported Profiles
Lower level Host Stack
Core specification 4.2. Not (yet) 3.0+HS. Includes GAP, L2CAP, RFCOMM and SDP.
Profiles

Provided by BlueZ:

* A2DP 1.3
* AVRCP 1.5
* DI 1.3
* HDP 1.0
* HID 1.0
* PAN 1.0
* SPP 1.1   <--- this...?

**GATT (LE) profiles:**

* PXP 1.0
* HTP 1.0
* HoG 1.0
* TIP 1.0
* CSCP 1.0

**OBEX based profiles (by obexd):**

* FTP 1.1
* OPP 1.1
* PBAP 1.1
* MAP 1.0

**Provided by the oFono project:**

* HFP 1.6 (AG & HF)

We have proof that Pi can support BT classic SPP:

However, we need to understand how bleno is interacting with the BlueZ libraries, because it has disabled the bluetooth service. 


* This question contains clues, but no answers: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/56050393/can-bluetooth-rfcomm-socket-be-opened-while-bleno-is-running
problem is this:
**the bluetooth daemon has to be shut down while the bleno server is up. So no BLueZ stack, and no SPP**

the reason for this is that bleno uses its own /bluetooth-hci-socket component, which goes straight to the kernel, and doen't use the BlueZ stack. When the BlueZ stack is on, it intercepts all GATT requests before bleno gets them.
there has been a patch suggested, which eanbles turning off the GATT services on BlueZ, so we can still use bleno. However, this means that we would still need to put something together to pair the devices. 

If really is better in the short-term to demostrate the concept with using the BLE UART, which is slow, but has souce code. We also have a bunch of BT5.0 dongles now.


* This is a UART implementation, using Bleno. May be REAL SLOW:
